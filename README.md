## Workflow

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow for fault detection:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Gather the dataset containing information about transmission line parameters and fault occurrences. Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to understand the relationships between different features and identify potential patterns associated with faults. Visualizations like graphs and plots are used to gain insights.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection:** Extract relevant features from the dataset or create new ones that might improve the accuracy of fault detection. Select the most informative features for model training.

4. **Model Selection & Training:** Choose suitable machine learning models based on the nature of the data and the specific fault detection task. Train the selected models using the prepared dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation & Comparison:** Evaluate the performance of different models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one.

6. **Visualization & Interpretation:** Visualize the results of the fault detection process using techniques like confusion matrices and other relevant plots. Interpret the results to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the models.

7. **Deployment & Monitoring:** Deploy the chosen model for real-time or offline fault detection in a power system. Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain or adjust it as needed.
